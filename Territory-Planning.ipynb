    "##### Getting the Necessary data elements:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Account-level firmographics (industry, size, location, region)\n",
    "- Historical sales (ARR, pipeline contribution, win rate)\n",
    "- Engagement activity (touchpoints, meetings, email opens)\n",

    "  - Industry vertical (e.g., Finance, Retail, Healthcare)\n",
    "  - Tech stack (e.g., Snowflake users, existing BI tools)\n",

    "\n",
    "The `territory_index` quantifies the workload and revenue potential of a rep's assigned accounts. It's used to ensure **equitable** territory design.\n",

    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "territory_index = (total_projected_arr * 0.6)\n",
    "                + (account_count * 0.3)\n",
    "                + (avg_account_score * 0.1)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- Weights represent business priorities (revenue vs. volume vs. quality).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### How would you avoid common pitfalls?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Apply clear, rules-based logic to avoid manual cherry-picking\n",
    "- Run simulations to detect and prevent over-concentration of high-potential accounts in one territory\n",
    "- Consider rep utilization and capacity alongside account score\n",
    "- Ensure transparency by documenting business rules in dbt models and on a company repository\n",
    "- Build dashboards for leadership to validate carve fairness before rollout\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### üß± Data Foundation\n",
    "- Created synthetic datasets for:\n",
    "  - B2B accounts (`synthetic_b2b_sales_data.csv`)\n",
    "  - Sales rep performance (`synthetic_rep_performance.csv`)\n",
    "  - Current assignments (`synthetic_current_assignments.csv`)\n",
