    "\n",
    "##### Getting the Necessary data elements:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Account-level firmographics (industry, size, location, region)\n",
    "- Historical sales (ARR, pipeline contribution, win rate)\n",
    "- Engagement activity (touchpoints, meetings, email opens)\n",
    "- Current rep ownership and performance\n",
    "- Tech stack (BI tool, data warehouse)\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Key account attributes to prioritize when carving:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Segment (SMB, Mid-Market, Enterprise)\n",
    "- Region and Geo coverage\n",
    "- Industry vertical\n",
    "- Current data stack (Snowflake, Azure, etc.)\n",
    "- ICP Fit + engagement level(marketing or account activity)\n",
    "- Estimated account potential (ARR projection)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### How would you propose we balance territories?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use a territory index that accounts for:\n",
    "  - Number of accounts\n",
    "  - Projected ARR\n",
    "  - Engagement score\n",
    "  - ICP fit\n",
    "\n",
    "- Normalize index values to ensure each rep receives an equitable workload\n",
    "\n",
    "- Carve by a mix of:\n",
    "  - Segment (e.g., SMB, Mid-Market, Enterprise)\n",
    "  - Geo (e.g., North America, EMEA, APAC)\n",
    "  - Industry vertical (e.g., Finance, Retail, Healthcare)\n",
    "  - Tech stack (e.g., Snowflake users, existing BI tools)\n",
    "\n",
    "##### How would you avoid common pitfalls?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Apply clear, rules-based logic to avoid manual cherry-picking\n",
    "- Run simulations to detect and prevent over-concentration of high-potential accounts in one territory\n",
    "- Consider rep utilization and capacity alongside account score\n",
    "- Ensure transparency by documenting business rules in dbt models and on a company repository\n",
    "- Build dashboards for leadership to validate carve fairness before rollout\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### üß± Data Foundation\n",
    "- Created synthetic datasets for:\n",
    "  - B2B accounts (`synthetic_b2b_sales_data.csv`)\n",
    "  - Sales rep performance (`synthetic_rep_performance.csv`)\n",
